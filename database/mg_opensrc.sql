A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle\'s narrow neck.[15] \n \nPlayers can select the degree of starting difficulty any time a new game is started. The initial level chosen is a value between zero and twenty that determines the number of viruses to clear, and the three game speed options change how fast the capsules fall in the bottle. The player\'s score is based solely on the elimination of viruses, not on the time taken to complete the level or the number of capsules used. If players complete the highest difficulty level, they can continue playing to accumulate a higher score, but the number of viruses to clear remains the same. Additional points are awarded when multiple viruses are eliminated at once, but no additional points are awarded for initiating chain reactions, in which the elimination of one set of objects triggers the elimination of another set. The game speed is also a factor in how the game calculates scoring; higher speed levels yield more points.', 'D', 521, 0, 3.55, 'http://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tfz.jpg'),

The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series. \nDragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character\'s stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles. \nThe remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting &quot;Tidy Item&quot; and &quot;Tidy Bag&quot; commands; and the &quot;Full HP&quot; command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. \nWhile the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another &quot;major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.&quot;', 'D', 534, 0, 3.9, 'http://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1xaj.jpg'),

These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy. \nAnother gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player\'s fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a &quot;boss Galaga&quot; (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player\'s current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large. \nGalaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous &quot;Split-Screen bug&quot; in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game &quot;rolls over&quot; from Level 255 to Level 0.

Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yÅkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter.

Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins.

Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game. \n \nThough by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks. \n \nThe game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game\'s 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes.

Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing its speed to maximum. There are three enemies in all: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; and the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform. Players may also make use of the above-mentioned &quot;POW&quot; block, which flips any enemy touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. This item can be used three times before it disappears. Coins appear whenever enemies are defeated and may be collected for bonus points. \nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and Slipices can freeze platforms, causing Mario and Luigi to skid. In addition, icicles start to form under the platforms and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the &quot;POW&quot; block regenerates itself on each of these screens.', 'M', 875, 0, 3.8, 'http://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1tg0.jpg'),

Three items are of absolute importance: The Air Dash sprite sheet, the N (Chimera) armor, and the Dual Buster. The last two are needed to get items, but the Air Dash is essential to even reach some of the bosses, making it the first item you should ever attempt to get. I\'m am not an avid advocator of entering a board to get an item, and dying to exit the stage, but some beginners may want to consider doing this to get the Buster and N sprites. I mention this because the path I suggest following puts off getting these items until later into the game, which in turn forces you to get other items even later.\n\nMega Man Sprite order is important, as it always is. It wouldn\'t be a Mega Man game without and boss order to follow. However, in MMX3, the correct weapon doesn\'t do tons of damage like you would expect. What\'s important in MMX3 is that the correct weapon cancels the bosses\' attacks. Some of the bosses attack you in such a way that they nail you with a barrage and don\'t allow you to retaliate. That is why following the order is a lot wiser to do than before. Only certain weapons will give you the opportunity to press your attack on the sprite.\n\nTherefore, the best Mega Man sprite sheet to rip first is Blizzard Buffalo. Not only is he the (possibly only) easiest Mega Man sprite to finish off with your normal X-Buster, but housed in his stage is the essential Air Dash power up capsule. I will proceed to each stage here. I will list how to reach all the items within each stage, as well as how to beat that particular boss. The listing of each stage will be in the proper sequence one should take to get through them. Listed in brackets will be what is needed to get that item.

Part of the Punch-Out!! series, it is a port of both the Punch-Out!! and Super Punch-Out!! arcade games (particularly the latter) with some variations. \nPunch-Out!! features a boxer known as Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version. \nLittle Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. The player can acquire up to three stars. To perform the uppercut, the player needs to press the start button once a star is earned. To defend, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block punches by putting up his guard. \nLittle Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking/dodging the player\'s attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack but still able to dodge or block. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent\'s punches. He immediately loses all of his hearts upon being knocked down, but can regain some by getting up. \nA bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within ten seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate higher than a certain point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down (different boxers require different point totals to win by decision). However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner and will automatically result in a loss for the player if the opponent is not knocked out. Mac can only get up three times during any one bout; if he is knocked down a fourth time, he will be unable to rise and thus lose by knockout. \nWhen Mac loses his first bout to a ranked opponent, he will have a chance to fight a rematch. However, if he loses a Title Bout, he will fall in the rankings - one place for the Minor or Major Circuits, two places for the World Circuit. Losing a rematch causes him to fall one place (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit), forcing him to fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.', 'P', 908, 0, 4.15, 'http://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co1hrk.jpg'),

Each trip is divided into a number of rounds, the end of which provides Pac-Man with bonus points depending on how much time he has left and also his position in jumping at the end of each round.

(11, 'Paperboy', '31st December, 1985', 'Paperboy is a 1985 arcade game by Atari Games originally developed in 1984 . The players take the role of a paperboy who delivers newspapers along a suburban street on his bicycle. The game was ported to numerous video game consoles and personal computers. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version represented the first NES game developed in the United States and coincidentally, the Sega Master System version represented the first SMS game developed in the United Kingdom. Paperboy was innovative for its theme and novel controls. \n \n \nGAMEPLAY: \nThe player controls a paperboy on a bicycle delivering newspapers along a suburban street which is displayed in a cabinet perspective (or oblique projection) view. The player attempts to deliver a week of daily newspapers to subscribing customers, attempts to vandalize non-subscribers\' homes and must avoid hazards along the street. Subscribers are lost by missing a delivery or damaging a subscriber\'s house. \n \nThe game begins with a choice of difficulty levels: Easy Street, Middle Road and Hard Way. The object of the game is to perfectly deliver papers to subscribers for an entire week and avoid crashing (which counts as one of the player\'s lives) before the week ends. The game lasts for seven in-game days, Monday through Sunday. \n \nControlling the paperboy with the handlebar controls, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers. Each day begins by showing an overview of the street indicating subscribers and non-subscribers. Subscribers and non-subscribers\' homes are also easy to discern in the level itself, with subscribers living in brightly colored houses, and non-subscribers living in dark houses. \n \nDelivering the papers \nThe paperboy begins his route at the start of the street (bottom of the screen) and progresses towards the end. The player can control the paperboy\'s speed, but the paperboy is in constant movement and cannot stop moving forward until the level (day of the week) has ended. Should he slow down or stop for more than a few seconds, a swarm of bees will appear (arcade version only). For each paper that is delivered to a subscriber\'s mailbox, the player receives 250 points. If the paper is delivered to the subscriber\'s doorstep, the player receives 100 points. Points are multiplied x2 for playing \'Middle Road\', and x3 for playing \'Hard Way\'. Points can be gained for breaking plants, running over flowers, or throwing papers into windows of the non-subscriber houses. \n \n \nIn Paperboy, the player attempts to deliver newspapers to subscribers along a suburban street. \nThe primary objectives of the game are to keep as many subscribers as possible and to stay alive. Secondary objectives include vandalizing non-subscribers\' homes and hitting nuisances with newspapers. \n \nKeeping subscribers is fairly straightforward: the player must deliver a paper to them. While the player may deliver more than one paper to each customer, they have to avoid accidentally damaging their homes, such as by throwing a paper through a window. Delivering a newspaper directly into the customer\'s newspaper box (or mailbox, as the voiceover calls it) earns bonus points. Accidentally damaging a customer\'s home or failing to deliver a paper causes the customer to cancel his subscription and may cause him to set traps for the paperboy the next day. In more advanced rounds, the homeowner may immediately run after the paperboy after the house is damaged. \n \nThe player must stay alive by avoiding obstacles that appear along the street. Some obstacles include everyday nuisances such as fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboarders, drunks, kids with radio controlled toys and even rather bizarre foes such as a tornado, oversized house cats, and even the Grim Reaper himself. The player must also cross street intersections successfully (which gets harder each day). Some obstacles can earn the player bonus points. For example, the breakdancer and some men brawling in the street can be &quot;smacked&quot; with a newspaper for extra points. Running into any of the obstacles with the bike results in the loss of a life. \n \nThere are two types of collisions possible from running into obstacles, &quot;%#@*!&quot; and &quot;SMACK!&quot; The former results from hitting obstacles that are integral parts of the landscape, such as fire hydrants, fences, and signposts. The latter collision type comes from obstacles not integral to the landscape: cars, people, dogs and bees. \n \nAlong the way, the paperboy can pick up extra bundles of papers since he can carry only a limited number. These are sometimes located in difficult to reach spots. \n \nA \'Perfect Delivery\' is achieved by successfully delivering to all current subscribers. This award doubles bonus points for each house delivered to, as well as reinstating one lost subscriber - up to a maximum of 10 out of the 20 houses being subscribers. If a \'Perfect Delivery\' is achieved when the player already has 10 subscribers, double bonus points are still', 'P', 1004, 0, 2.6, 'http://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/y1ad39sesw16yhq8w2zw.jpg'),

In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally. \n \nStage 2 - First Day \nThe first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car\'s speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage. \n \nStage 3 - Second Day \nThis mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player\'s car to deter them. \n \nStage 4 - Third Day \nThe action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue. \n \nStage 5 - Fourth Day \nAs the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks. \n \nStage 6 - Fifth Day \nInto the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts. \n \nStage 7 - Sixth Day \nAt some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line. \n \nStage 8 - Final Day \nThe Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day.

And you donâ€™t sit still if you let go of the control pad, you have to hit A to stop. And then you have to hit A again to fall to the ground and walk around like normal. Which is all very weird. But you can jump REALLY high, so thatâ€™s cool. \n \nThereâ€™s a side view, where you can fly, like what I was just talking about, and thereâ€™s a top view, where you walk around inside of buildings and stuff.

Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird\'s eye view of the field.

The player only controls the protagonist directly, but can issue different strategic commands to other party members that, in turn, influence their AI as they fight. Furthermore, while fights do consist of random encounters, they take place on the same playing field as the game world itself, meaning that there are no transitions into battle-specific arenas like turn-based RPGs at the time such as Final Fantasy. Experience points are also gained in real-time as each character defeats enemies. When battles have concluded, the player receives complimentary items before being whisked back to the point on the map where they were walking prior to the fighting.', 'T', 1278, 0, 2.5, ''),

After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader.

(11, 'Vindicators', '31st December, 1988', 'he game begins by asking the player(s) to choose a difficulty level, not only making the enemies more difficult and the players weaker, but higher difficulties start the players in a later set of levels (called &quot;galaxies&quot;) and with some powerups. The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station. \n \nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level. \n \nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player\'s tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost. \n \nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt. A later version of the game was released which eliminated the contest levels and stars.', 'V', 1312, 0, 2.5, 'http://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/ntbteeq60ihtvcmwukkv.jpg'),

(91, 156, 0, 'Mirrored from https://archive.org/details/Super_Mario_Bros_C64_Zeropaige\r\n\r\nThis is a Commodore 64 port of the 1985 game SUPER MARIO BROS. for the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System. It contains the original version that was released in Japan and United States, as well as the European version. It also detects and supports a handful of turbo functionalities, and has 2 SID support. \r\n\r\nVSP (VARIABLE SCREEN POSITIONING) \r\n\r\nThis port relies on the VSP-technique for scrolling. If you experience crashes while playing the game, this is most likely the issue. You may find out if your computer is prone to crashing by running VSP Lab. \r\n\r\nhttps://csdb.dk/release/?id=120810 \r\n\r\nIf this is the case, there are a number of things to try (some options cheaper than others): \r\n\r\n- Try another C64. \r\n- Use an emulator instead. \r\n- Use a C64 Reloaded motherboard - they are designed to be VSP-safe. \r\n- Use a Turbo Chameleon - because of how it works, VSP glitches will not alter the Chameleons memory, thus preventing the game from crashing. This port will also benefit from its turbo functionality. \r\n\r\n\r\nOPTION MENU \r\n\r\nBefore the game starts, an option menu will let you: \r\n\r\n- select a version of the game. \r\n- disable turbo (if detected). \r\n- configure a second SID-chip. \r\n- see the background (based on Shigeru Miyamotos artwork that was used for the Japanese and European release). \r\n\r\nThe option menu is (just like this manual) controlled using a joystick (or gamepad) in either control port. \r\n\r\nThe details of these options will now be described. \r\n\r\n\r\nVERSIONS AND TIMING \r\n\r\nThe original game was released in two versions: \r\n\r\n- Japanese/US-release - the original for NTSC, 60 Hz video systems. \r\n\r\n- European-release - adjusted for PAL, 50 Hz video systems. \r\n\r\nThis port will try to run the game at the intended speed (as well as having the sound in the correct pitch); this means you can play either version on any type of C64. It also means that the Japanese/US-release will not play 20% slower on a PAL-system. Likewise, the European-release will not play 20% faster on an NTSC-system. \r\n\r\nThe program will automatically detect your hardware (including any turbo functionality). Based on this, it will suggest the best version for you. \r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind the suggested version is as follows: \r\n\r\n- If you play on a stock C64 (PAL, Drean or any NTSC) without any turbo functionality, the European-release will give you the least slowdowns, since the original game-engine is tuned for a 50 Hz refresh-rate which uses less CPU-cycles per second than the original Japanese/US-release. \r\n\r\n- If turbo functionality is detected, the version aimed for your video-system will give you the smoothest scrolling. This means: Japanese/US-release on any NTSC C64, European-release on PAL and Drean C64. \r\n\r\nYou can override the suggested version, if you wish. \r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY AND TURBO \r\n\r\nVSP issues aside, this port should be able to run on all regional C64 models. PAL, NTSC (new and old) and Drean (PAL-N) are all supported. \r\n\r\nSince the NES-processor is clocked (roughly 70%) faster than a stock C64 there can be slowdowns during gameplay. A pixel indicates this on the time-watch graphics in the status bar. \r\n\r\nThis port will try to detect and use any kind of turbo functionality, such as: \r\n\r\n- Commodore 128 (2 MHz in the border) \r\n- C64 DTV \r\n- Schnedler Systems Turbo Master CPU (untested) \r\n- Swisscomp Turbo Processor (untested) \r\n- Rossmoeller Flash 8 (untested) \r\n- CMD SuperCPU Accelerator (untested) \r\n- Icomp Turbo Chameleon 64 \r\n\r\nYou can disable the detected turbo functionality if you experience problems with it enabled (or wish to see how the game performs without it). \r\n\r\n\r\n2 SID SUPPORT \r\n\r\n- This port emulates 4 channels of the NES APU (audio processing unit): 2 pulse channels, 1 triangle channel and 1 noise channel. The SID-chip has 3 voices, so this is handled by sharing 1 SID-voice for the triangle and noise channel. \r\n\r\n- If a second SID-chip is configured, the program will instead dedicate 2 APU-channels to each SID-chip. \r\n\r\n- In the option menu you are able to configure and test your SID-setup. You can use the following addresses for the second SID-chip: $D420, $D500, $DE00 and $DF00. \r\n\r\n\r\n- In the test you should be able to hear 2 tones being played simultaneously for 2 seconds.

The title, which follows the events of Half-Life, took five years to develop; the result was quite positive, thanks to the much acclaimed Source engine, which brought new graphics and physics to the game.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in city 17 in a brief future, where Dr. Gordon Freeman, the protagonist, is agreed. He finds himself in a repressed environment, and must fight to survive, joining those who share the ideal of changing that reality.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula of Half-Life 2 is the same as its predecessor: the player crosses several locations solving puzzles and facing enemies ranging from soldiers to hideous aliens. The big difference is due to the graphics and physical, which gave rise to new types of puzzles.\r\n\r\nA great novelty in the game is the gravity weapon, which can be used to move objects from a distance and shoot them basically, but its use goes far beyond. The player can move objects in their favor to get cover or create structures to climb and reach higher places, for example - your creativity is the limit.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: First Person Shooting\r\nYear: 2004\r\nGame size: 1.57 GB\r\n\r\nMinimum requirements\r\n\r\nProcessor: Pentium IV 1.2 GHz or Athlon equivalent\r\nProcessor Speed: 1.2 GHz\r\nMemory RAM: 256 MB\r\nVideo Memory: 32 MB\r\nDirect3D: Yes\r\nDirectX Version: 7.0\r\nOperating Systems: Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP', 'Half Life 2', 'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e6168462b884d02d2d1fcdfc3079f835903c839d&amp;dn=Half-Life+2+%28Install+and+Play%29+-+By+Lipe+WC&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969&amp;tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969', 1557761901, 21, 0, 0, NULL),

The first option (Prologue) plays the prologue obviously but it gets up to the Angela cemetery scene, after that if you go to the gate it says coming soon. In the Battle option you are spawned into a version of the Apartments that already has things unlocked and given for some reason but it acts like the first time you\'ve been in them so you still have things to do. You can get up to the pyramid head scene where James shoots through the closet before pyramid walks off and the game says coming soon again.', 'Silent Hill 2 - August 2001 Trial',
