	<h3>What are Magnet Links?</h3>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/magnetlinks.png" title="Magnet Links"><br><br>
	Magnet links are an increasingly popular way to make downloading and sharing torrent files even faster and easier! <br>
	Sometimes called "Magnet URIs," magnet links let you download content through a torrent client by just using a plain-text link!
	
	<hr>
	<h3>How do Magnet Links differ from .torrent files?</h3>
	With magnet links, you no longer need to download a ".torrent" file to download a torrent.<br>
	Magnet links have the same functionality as a ".torrent" file. To use magnet URIs, you need only ensure that your torrent client is associated with them.<br>
	Then you can just click a magnet link and your browser will let a torrent client do the rest! If not, you can always copy the magnet link manually into a torrent client<br>
	
	<hr>
	<h3>Torrent Clients? Torrents? What are they?</h3>
	Torrent clients are software that are capable of using ".torrent" files and <b>Magnet Links</b>.<br>
	In the BitTorrent file distribution system, a ".torrent" file or "METAINFO" is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.<br>
	<br>
	A torrent file <i>does <b>not</b></i> contain the content to be distributed, it only contains information about those files, such as their names, sizes, folder structure, and cryptographic hash values for verifying file integrity.<br>
	The term torrent may refer either to the metadata file or to the files downloaded, depending on the context.<br>
	<br>
	<h3 id="clients">The three most popular Torrent Clients are:</h3>
	<b><a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php">qBittorrent</a></b><br>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/qbittorrent.png" title="qBittorrent Logo"><br>
	qBittorrent is a cross-platform free and open-source BitTorrent client.<br>
	qBittorrent is written in C++, and thus is a native application. It uses Boost, Qt toolkit, and libtorrent-rasterbar library.<br>
	Due to being free and open-source, this is the client MagnetGames recommends most.<br>
	<br>
	<b><a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/downloads">BitTorrent</a></b><br>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/bittorrent.png" title="BitTorrent Logo"><br>
	BitTorrent is the original Torrent Client, it is a desktop application that initiates, truncates and manages the downloading and uploading of data using BitTorrent file-sharing protocol.<br>
	Unlike qBittorrent, BitTorrent is proprietary and contains ads.<br>	
	<br>
	<b><a href="https://www.utorrent.com/downloads">μTorrent</a></b><br>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/utorrent.png" title="uTorrent Logo"><br>
	μTorrent (or uTorrent) is a Torrent client owned and developed by BitTorrent, Inc. With over 150 million users it is the most widely used BitTorrent client outside China.<br>
	Like the BitTorrent client, μTorrent is proprietary and contains ads aswell, but is more actively developed.
	<hr>
	<h3>Downloading from Magnet Links</h3>
	Once a torrent client is installed, simply clicking on magnet links in your browser should bring up a prompt.<br>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/clientprompt.png" title="Browser Prompt"><br>
	Clicking allow will forward the magnet link directly to your torrent client! Which should then begin to download from other peers/leachers.<br><br>
	Alternatively, you can also copy the link itself and paste it directly into your torrent client.<br>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/manualmagnet.png" title="Manually adding a Magnet Link to a Torrent Client"><br>
	<hr>
	<h3>Seeders, Peers and Leachers</h3>
	There are generally 3 terms for the users on the other end of the torrent client.<br>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/seeders.gif" title="Seeders/Peers"><img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/leachers.gif" title="Leachers"><br>
	<br>
	<h4>Seeders</h4>
	The term <b style="color: #008800">seeders</b> refers to users who have <b>all the content</b> and are sharing it.<br>
	In other words, these are the users you'll be downloading most of the data from.<br>
	This also means that the more seeders present per torrent, the quicker the torrent will download!<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Peers</h4>
	The term <b style="color: #668800">peers</b> refers to the users who are also downloading the files, but don't have the entire thing downloaded yet.<br>
	In some cases even if there are no seeders connected, if there are enough peers that have different parts of the torrent then the whole torrent can still be downloaded.<br>
	E.g. A peer has <b>50%</b> of the torrent, and a 2nd peer has the other <b>50%.</b><br>
	As long as both are connected to your client, you can still get the whole torrent.<br>
	<br>
	But if there's just a peer with <b>37%</b> of the torrent, and another has <b>58%</b> of the torrent...<br>
	Then only <u><i><b>95%</b></i></u> of the torrent can be downloaded (unless more seeders/peers connects later on).<br>
	<br>
	<h4>Leachers</h4>
	Then there's the term <b style="color: #880000">leachers</b>.<br>
	These users often aren't listed in the torrent clients themselves (they're just seen as peers), but are often listed separately on torrent index websites.<br>
	Leachers are basically peers (so users also downloading the torrent), however the difference is that they barely upload back to others.<br>
	Users are labled as leachers if they have a very slow upload connection, or are just limiting their uploading speed in the client.<br>
	<hr>
	<h3>Sharing Magnet Links to MagnetGames</h3>
	Most torrent clients have the ability to copy the Magnet Link to the clipboard!
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/copylink.png" title="Copying a Magnet Link"><br><br>
	Then it's as easy as pasting it in the bottom box on the submission page on MagnetGames!<br>
	<img src="./cssimg/guides/magnet/magnetsub.png" title="MagnetGames Magnet Link Submissions"><br>
	<hr>
	<h3>What are trackers?</h3>
	A Torrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol.<br>
	The "tracker" server keeps track of where file copies reside on peer machines, keep track of other peers, and helps coordinate efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file.<br>
	Clients that have already begun downloading communicate with the tracker periodically to negotiate faster file transfer with new peers, and provide seeders/leacher statistics.<br>
	After the initial peer-to-peer file download is started, peer-to-peer communication can continue <i>without</i> the connection to a tracker.<br><br>
	Since the creation of the <b>distributed hash table (DHT)</b> for "Trackerless" torrents, trackers have largely become redundant.<br>
	However, they are still often included with torrents to improve the speed of peer discovery.<br><br>
	Here's a large list of public trackers you can use in your torrents!<br><br>
